Comprehensive Patch Visualization Information
============================================================
Generated: create_comprehensive_patch_visualizations.py
Configuration modus: data_with_zero_mean
Patch size: 10x10
Classes: [1, 4, 6, 12]
Total patches sampled: 5

Spatial Processing Methods (Conv2D_N2):
- raw: Original pixel values (no preprocessing)
- zero_mean: Per-channel mean subtraction
- quantiles: Quantile transformation (spatial structure preserved)
- spatial_shuffle_0mean: Spatial shuffling + zero-mean normalization
- spatial_shuffle: Pixel shuffling (spectral relationships preserved)

Statistical Processing Methods (LinearStatsNet):
- std: Standard deviation features (2 features: std_VV, std_VH)
- meanandstd: Combined mean and std features (4 features: mean_VV, std_VV, mean_VH, std_VH)
- mean: Mean features (2 features: mean_VV, mean_VH)

Generated Files:
- tiff_files/: GeoTIFF files for spatial processing methods
- spatial_overviews/: PNG overview plots for spatial methods
- statistical_mini_plots/: Mini visualizations for statistical features
